# Can you figure out the issues? 

## Scenario:
**You work at a fintech startup as a junior software developer. You've been tasked with a critical challenge!**

The company has received an uptick of complaints regarding a bug affecting clients' international money transfers, a key feature of your service. Fortunately, thanks to your hard work and expertise, you've found the root cause of the issue and applied the necessary fixes to the `intl-money-transfer-app` repository and are ready to roll out these changes.

However, as you initiate the deployment process, you run into an unexpected problem. The application pods just won't come up! 

_Can you apply your strong problem-solving skills and kubernetes knowhow to ensure that the critical fix that you've worked so hard for can go live?_
